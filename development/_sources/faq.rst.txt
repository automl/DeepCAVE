==========================


DeepCAVE is not starting. What's wrong?
    Make sure you have installed redis-server before you start the server.

My machine is not the fastest and I have some issues (e.g. content is not updating) when using plugins with the queue. What can I do?
    It might be the case that your machine is too slow to update the content before one calculation
    circle was finished. Increasing the refresh rate could help. To do so, set `REFRESH_RATE`
    to a higher value in the DeepCAVE config file.
