Pareto Front
============

Pareto efficiency or Pareto optimality is a situation where no individual or preference
configuration can be chosen due to multiple important objectives which should be considered.
For example, I want to find a configuration for my problem which has both a good performance
and low computational cost. To select a suitable configuration, the pareto front shows you the best
configurations for two given objectives.

.. note::
    You can enable or disable specific runs if you click on the name right to the plot.
    If you click on a configuration you a redirected to the configuration plugin to see 
    the configuration in detail.

This plugin is capable of answering following questions:

* Which configuration should I choose if I prefer objective A slightly over objective B?
* How performs optimizer A in comparison to optimizer B? Is optimizer A better than optimizer B?
