Budget Correlation
==================

When multiple budgets are used, it can be challenging to determine how representative lower budgets
are of the final objective score if the same configuration were evaluated at a higher budget.
One way to assess this is through *budget correlation*. If a lower budget correlates well with a
higher budget, it indicates that evaluating configurations at a lower budget is likely good enough
to infer their performance at higher budgets. Conversely, if a low budget does not correlate with
higher budgets, it suggests that full evaluation at higher budgets is necessary to get an accurate
performance measure.

For instance, in neural networks, once convergence is achieved, longer training may not
significantly impact the result. If convergence is reached at budget 1 but training continues until
budget 2, the correlation between budgets 1 and 2 will be high.

This plugin is capable of answering following questions:

* Are low budget trials a fair representation of a configuration's true performance if evaluated at
  a higher budget?
* Should I consider running further optimization at lower budgets to cover more of the
  configuration space?

Correlation Interpretation
--------------------------

The first step is to evaluate how the highest budget correlates with all lower budgets. You can
start by verifying that the highest budget perfectly correlates with itself, which will give you a
correlation value of 1. Then, you can trace the correlation of this highest budget with previous,
lower budgets.

Typically, you may find that the highest budget shows a stronger correlation with mid-range budgets
and the correlation tends to decrease as you compare it with progressively lower budgets.

There is no definitive threshold for what a specific correlation value means, as it depends on your
goals and the resources available. If you aim to determine whether you can conduct further runs with
reduced budgets to expedite the search for optimal configurations, ensure that the highest budget
has a strong correlation with the lowest budget, ideally achieving a correlation score of at least
0.7. This number is somewhat arbitrary and should be interpreted in the context of your specific
situation. For reference, hereâ€™s a guideline for interpreting correlation scores:

* \>=0.70: Very strong relationship
* 0.40-0.69: Strong relationship
* 0.30-0.39: Moderate relationship
* 0.20-0.29: Weak relationship
* 0.01-0.19: No or negligible relationship
