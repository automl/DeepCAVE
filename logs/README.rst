Example Logs
============

This directory contains exemplary run logs from hyperparameter optimization runs created with
AMLTK, BOHB, Optuna, and SMAC3.
Furthermore, it contains example logs created with the DeepCAVE recorder and example logs in
CSV format.

After starting DeepCAVE, you can load these logs by navigating to the directory containing the run
log you would like to load on the `General` site and then selecting the run log via clicking on
the `+` next to it.
