DeepCAVE
---------

You can incorporate DeepCAVE into your AutoML tool directly to save your results in the native
DeepCAVE format and then analyze it in DeepCAVE. Please see the :ref:`examples` on this.

To be able to load it correctly into DeepCAVE, your run needs to at least contain a history JSONL file:

   .. code-block:: python

      "history.jsonl"
