SMAC
----

For the SMAC framework, we support loading runs created with the older SMAC version 1.4 as well as
runs created with the newer SMAC version >= 2.0.0.

As Auto-Sklearn and Auto-PyTorch rely on SMAC for hyperparameter optimization, the SMAC
converter also allows to load runs created with these tools.
