Record
^^^^^^

You can incorporate DeepCAVE directly to save your results in DeepCAVE format. To do so,
you have to use the `Record` class. See the following examples to get an idea of how to log your
AutoML runs.

In order to run the `mnist_pytorch.py` example, some additional packages need to be installed.
You can install them via the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    make install-examples
